# Reyne Drops

Reyne Drops is a custom linksharing app that I built in place of linktree so that I could customize it to my liking... and not have to pay for linktrees premium features.

This is project is very simple and open source for anyone who would like to use it. The only requirement is that you link back to this repo in the footer.

## Getting Started

If you would like to use this repo follow these steps:

## > Fork this repo

## > Clone the forked repo

```bash
 npm install
```

## > Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## > Make any changes you would like.

(make sure to keep a link to this repo in the footer)

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/drops). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/drops.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
